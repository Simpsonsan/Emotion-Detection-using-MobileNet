In the present era an immense amount of research work is going on in the 
field of digital image and image processing. The way of progression has been 
exponential and it is ever increasing. Image Processing is a vast area of 
research in present day world and its applications are very widespread. 
Image processing is the field of signal processing where both the input and output 
signals are images. One of the most important applications of Image 
processing is Facial emotion recognition. Our emotion is revealed by the 
expressions on our face. 
Automatic recognition of facial expression plays an important role in 
artificial intelligence and robotics and thus it is a need of the generation. 
Some application related to this include Personal identification and Access 
control, Videophone and Teleconferencing, Forensic application, 
HumanComputer Interaction, Automated Surveillance, Cosmetology and so on. The 
objective of this project is to develop Automatic Facial Expression 

Recognition System which can take human facial images from camera
containing some expression as input and recognize and classify it into five
different expression class such as (with experimental results):
